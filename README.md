# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Explanation
This repository contain the code and explanation behind how the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm works and an example on how to utilize it for classification task.
The ml_from_scratch folder contains the base code and code for either classification or regression task. The usage_example.py code gives an example on how to utilize the code to execute classification task on the diabetes.csv dataset.

A more detailed explanation on the code is available at Medium with the following link: https://medium.com/@evelyn.eve.9512/k-nearest-neighbors-behind-the-scene-and-example-33ada564223e
